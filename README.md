# Flexbox

A simple example of flexbox layout, based on the tutorial at <https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html>.

“Flexbox” layout mode offers an alternative to Floats for defining the overall appearance of a web page. Whereas floats only let us horizontally position our boxes, flexbox gives us *complete* control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes.

Use flexbox to lay out your web pages as much as possible, reserving floats for when you need text to flow around a box (i.e., a magazine-style layout) or when you need to support legacy web browsers.

## Summary

* display: flex; to create a flex container.
* justify-content to define the horizontal alignment of items.
* align-items to define the vertical alignment of items.
* flex-direction if you need columns instead of rows.
  * the row-reverse or column-reverse values to flip item order.
* order to customize the order of individual elements.
* align-self to vertically align individual items.
* flex to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.
