# Flexbox

A simple example of flexbox layout, based on the tutorial at <https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html>.

“Flexbox” layout mode offers an alternative to Floats for defining the overall appearance of a web page. Whereas floats only let us horizontally position our boxes, flexbox gives us *complete* control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes.

Use flexbox to lay out your web pages as much as possible, reserving floats for when you need text to flow around a box (i.e., a magazine-style layout) or when you need to support legacy web browsers.
